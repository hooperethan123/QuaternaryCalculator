# QuaternaryCalculator
By Ethan Hooper

## How To Run
Once you load the project files onto Intellij, the first thing you will want to do is hover your mouse over the gradle tab on the far right of your screen.
From there, you will expand the task folder followed by the application folder and then double click the gear icon right next to the word run.

If you see something like this pop up on your screen then you have successfully launched the calculator.

You will then pick the first number that you would like in the equation by pressing the buttons labeled (1, 2, 3, 0)
After finishing your number, click an operator (+, -, *, /) and it will clear your screen. This means that you have stored your first number and your operator.
Put in the second number you want to use and then press equals, you should see the equation's result show up on the screen.

It is important to note that the calculator only stores the last two numbers and the last operator that you selected. For example, 11 * 3 + 2 will result in the equation 3 + 2 so the result will be 11.

## Meetings

As this was a solo project, I completed all the work by myself. 

Sunday was spent setting up IntelliJ and making sure Gradle was correctly configured.  
Monday is when most of the actual code was created.
